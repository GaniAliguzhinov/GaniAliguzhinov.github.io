Jekyll works great in combination with GitHub Pages (this site is built with it).

The workflow is as follows: struggle setting up your website, finish setting it up, 
post content with `git commit -a -m "meaningful commit" && git push`. From then on,
don't touch the settings until you need to change the theming.

The website will be hosted on your git repo, and github will autobuild it with jekyll 
whenever you make a commit. Jekyll looks for config files, looks at YAML headers in all 
markdown files, and tries to generate appropriate HTML files. It also parses html files too.

The easiest way to get started is to fork [Barry's repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
and read [his guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

Once you set up the fork, cloned the repo, you might want to consider building the site locally, 
especially if you want to check how your post looks like before pushing.

## Installing Jekyll

[Jekyll installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) shows how install Ruby, jekyll, bundler.

## Changing the style

You might want to change up the look of the website to make it feel more personal.

First thing you need to change is `_config.yml` properties: name, description, avatar, social links.

The home page will be served from either `index.md` or `index.html` in the root. 

The 404 page should also be modified.

Icons are stored as plaintext in the `_sass/_svg-icons.scss`. Everything from `base64,` to `)`
is a single icon. I recommend using 24px icons from [Iconscout](https://iconscout.com), as you 
can choose color there. Then, you would optionally compress them with an [svgo compresser](https://github.com/svg/svgo),
and convert to base 64 string with [mobilefish](https://www.mobilefish.com/services/base64/base64.php).

Finally, we need to change `width` and `height` in the same file to 24px.

Code is highlighted if it is enclosed into  \`\`\`sh \`\`\` style block line in markdown.
If code highlighting needs to be changed, you can fiddle with the `_sass/_highlights.scss` file.

Personally I use Chris Kempson's color scheme. It requires some color variables set, which can be done 
with `_sass/_variables.scss` file. There, you can also set fonts and other colors.

You can also install mathjax support by providing following in the head of `_layouts/default.html`:

```html
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
        tex2jax: {
            inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\(', '\\)']],
            processEscapes: true
        }
    });
</script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

If you don't like anything about the layout, don't shy away from fiddling with it.
