## What is ninja

Ninja is a a build system akin to make, but without wildcards.
This makes it unfeasible to develop with ninja alone, since any big project 
will emit rules for each source file, resulting in a huge number of dependencies in ninja build file.

To handle it, ninja is instead used as a generator by cmake, or a similiar 
higher level build language.
There is even a Python binding:

```py
from ninja_syntax import Writer

with open("build.ninja", "w") as f:
    Writer(f).rule("link", command="$cxx $ldflags -o $out $in $libs", description="LINK $out")
```

With CMake:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
# Ask CMake to generate Ninja build files
cmake -GNinja ..
# Ask Ninja to build with maximal number of threads.
ninja
```

Advantage of using Ninja over make is build speed after file change.
So, if you are working with a huge project where you wish to test the effect of changing a few files 
quite often, ninja is right for you.

## Installing ninja

```sh
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
```
