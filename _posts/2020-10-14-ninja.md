## What is ninja

Ninja is a a build system akin to make, but without wildcards.
This makes unfeasible development with ninja alone, since any big project 
will emit way too many rules. 

To handle it, ninja is instead used as a low-level build language emited by cmake, or a similiar 
higher level generator.
There is even a Python binding:

```py
from ninja_syntax import Writer

with open("build.ninja", "w") as f:
    Writer(f).rule("link", command="$cxx $ldflags -o $out $in $libs", description="LINK $out")
```

With CMake:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
# Ask CMake to generate Ninja build files
cmake -GNinja ..
# Ask Ninja to build with maximal number of threads.
ninja
```

Advantage of using Ninja over make is build speed after file change, which might be significant 
without Ninja.

## Installing ninja

```sh
sudo apt-get install ninja-build
```
